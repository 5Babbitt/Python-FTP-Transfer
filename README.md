# Python-FTP-Transfer
 A console applications used to zip files and send them to an FTP server


ZipUploader_V2.py is the Improved version as the first script was for an interview in which I had a 3 hour time limit.  
After the interview, I felt I was not done with this project yet so I continued to improve it by reducing redundant actions (like having to login for every file upload) and allowing the program to loop should you want to send more files, even to other FTP servers.
